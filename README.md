<B>Contribution of Team Members:</B>

All students contributed to the entire project as a whole and therefore it is nearly impossible to assign specific tasks to each student. Multiple meetings (through Discord) were held for coordination and questions. Each student was assigned parts initially but the project demanded all students to participate in every part. All students participated in meetings and have contributed to the project equally (although it is impossible to measure) and all three students agree with this statement.

<B> Since each person had difficulty to commit to Github separately/ or as a single file modified, we first decided to do all of the project on our Pycharm's App, and at the end one person share the whole project into Github repository via the button in pycharm called "Share the whole project in repository".</B>

# Rush-hour-MP2
Second Mini Project for comp 472
------------

<br>

<B>REQUIREMENTS</B>
1. Having Python 3.8 or above
2. Use this python as venv (interpretor)
3. activate venv

<br>

<b>TO RUN THE PROGRAM</b>

Simply run the main.py

<br>

<div>
  <span style="color:red"><B>Please Note:</B></span> <br> We wrote the code to generate 50 random puzzles in the class <B>PuzzleGenerator.py</B> and we saved it as <B>generatePuzzles.txt</B> under <u>input</u> folder. 
We also keep the <U>sample-input.txt</U> under input folder to test our program.
Since we want to <span style="color:rgb(136,176,75)">generate outputs(Search files & Solution files)</span> for our <B>generatePuzzles.txt</B> that contains 50 random puzzles, we used "generatedPuzzles text file" as <B>default</B> in the class <u>main.py</u> & we <B>open</B> this text file in the <B>PuzzleGenerator.py</B> class as well.

<br>

If You are plan to use different text file with different name in order to test our program, make sure to save this file under **input folder** and change the <U>default</U> value in **main.py** to its corresponding name as well as use its name in **PuzzleGenerator.py** to <U>open</U> it.

<br>

There is also a text file generated (called <b>analysis.txt</b>) to show the statistics of our algorithms' searches based on our 50 random puzzles.
