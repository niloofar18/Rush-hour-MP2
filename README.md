------------

<br>

<B>REQUIREMENTS</B>
1. Having Python 3.8 or above
2. Use this python as venv (interpretor)
3. activate venv
<br>
<b>TO RUN THE PROGRAM </b>
Simply run the main.py

<span style="color:red">Please Note:</span> <br> We wrote the code to generate 50 random puzzles in the class **PuzzleGenerator.py** and we saved it as **generatePuzzles.txt** under <U>input</U> folder. 
We also keep the <U>sample-input.txt</U> under input folder to test our program.
Since we want to <span style="color:rgb(136,176,75)">generate outputs(Search files & Solution files)</span> for our **generatePuzzles.txt** that contains 50 random puzzles, we used "generatedPuzzles text file" as **default** in the class <U>main.py</U> & we **open** this text file in the **PuzzleGenerator.py** class as well.

If You are plan to use different text file with different name in order to test our program, make sure to save this file under **input folder** and change the <U>default</U> value in **main.py** to its corresponding name as well as use its name in **PuzzleGenerator.py** to <U>open</U> it.
